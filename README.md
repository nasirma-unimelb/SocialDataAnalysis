## Project description:
In this project, we seek to evaluate this interplay in the context of the broader topic of housing, and data across social media and government resources. In a series of scenarios, we analyse the relationship between inflation, RBAâ€™s interest rate rises, and the interest in the topics within the general public, based on related posts on social media. In order to bring this project to life, a cloud-based system was developed on the Melbourne Research Cloud and OpenStack (e.g. Ansible and CouchDB). This report provides a detailed overview of technical implementation of the system, the data sources used, as well as findings from the data.
