## Project description:

The project focuses on an export of Twitter data
from the Australian Data Observatory (ADO - www.ado.eresearch.unimelb.edu.au) 1 , data to be harvested by students from the Mastodon APIs and data from the Spatial Urban Data Observatory (SUDO - https://sudo.eresearch.unimelb.edu.au). The focus of this assignment is to use a large Twitter corpus (that will be provided) to tell interesting stories of life in Australian and importantly how social media data can be used alongside/compared with/augment the official data available within the SUDO platform to improve our knowledge of life in Australia.
